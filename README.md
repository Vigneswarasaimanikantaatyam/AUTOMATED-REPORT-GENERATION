PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project was implemented using Jupyter Notebook, integrating data analysis, visualization, and automated report generation. The goal was to efficiently process a dataset, extract meaningful insights, and compile them into a structured PDF report using Python. The implementation began with loading a dataset from a CSV file using Pandas. Statistical analysis was performed to generate summary metrics, providing an overview of the datasetâ€™s characteristics. Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and data distribution were computed to help interpret trends. Instead of presenting raw numerical results, the summary was visualized as a graphical table using Matplotlib, ensuring clarity and professional presentation. To automate the reporting process, the project leveraged FPDF to generate a well-structured PDF report directly from Jupyter Notebook. The report consists of a header, a summary section, and an embedded visualization. The header introduces the report title, while the summary section provides structured data points extracted from the dataset. The graphical representation is included as a high-resolution image, making the report visually appealing and easy to understand. Additionally, a footer is dynamically generated to maintain proper pagination.# AUTOMATED-REPORT-GENERATION.
